# Have you ever played GeoGuessr?
## Are you a rock climber?
### Well then, test your knowledge of routes across the world.

RouteGuessr is a "GeoGuessr" styled web application that provides you with a random image from a selected area across the world.
Your goal? Try to use knowledge, context clues, and pure luck to guess exactly where is the image you're looking at.
Butt shots? Beta? Topos? Doesn't matter. That adds (or subtracks!) to the challenge!

To use this application, look no further than our hosting platform on Render!
